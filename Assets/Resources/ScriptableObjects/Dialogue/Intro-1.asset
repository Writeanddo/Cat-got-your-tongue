  Text: "Newscaster: Our next story tonight, We\u2019ve had reports of a large amount
    of random transformations of pets occurring. \r\nNewscaster:  We hand over to
    our reporter in the field, Cliff, to get all the details.\r\nReporter: Thanks
    Janice. I\u2019m here now with a recent victim of this weird phenomenon. Can
    you describe what happened to you?\r\nWorried Person: Um.. yes, I was just brushing
    my sheep\u2019s wool as usual, and all of a sudden a pink fog appeared around
    him!\r\nWorried Person: And then, my sheep grew three times the size!\r\nReporter:
    How concerning! What happened next?\r\nWorried Person: More fog appeared this
    time around me, and when it stopped, one of my eyes had gone!\r\n Worried Person:
    Luckily I still had one left so I could see, and I saw my sheep scurry off into
    the distance!\r\nWorried Person: I\u2019m now doing everything I can to find
    my sheep and hopefully get my other eye back!\r\nReporter: As you heard Janice,
    very strange happenings! And stories like this are popping up all over the place!\r\nNewscaster:
    Well Cliff, we have one message to whoever is doing this!\r\nNewscaster: We are
    Serious News\u2122 and you can\u2019t pull the wool over our eyes!"
